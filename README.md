## ✨ Features

- **Realtime link library** – drag-and-drop ordering powered by dnd-kit with live Convex updates.
- **Smart folders** – group, rename, reorder, and navigate between folders without page reloads.
- **Music link orchestration** – aggregate tracks, albums, and playlists across Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, Deezer, and more using one-click metadata fetches.
- **Media previews** – embed YouTube video cards that automatically replace default URLs.
- **Scheduling rules** – decide when links go live; the public profile updates instantly as schedule windows open.
- **Analytics at a glance** – Tinybird & Convex pipelines surface daily performance insights inside the dashboard.
- **Pro-grade UI** – Apple-inspired mobile menu, Clerk auth widgets, and theme toggler crafted with Tailwind CSS + Shadcn components.
- **Audit-friendly** – music metadata, profile customization, and creatives are all stored consistently in Convex documents.

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

Linkio is a full-stack application built with a modern, realtime-friendly toolkit:

- **Next.js 15 + React 19** for the application shell, ISR-ready marketing pages, and the Clerk-authenticated dashboard.
- **Convex** for the data layer (links, folders, music metadata, schedules) and realtime transports.
- **Clerk** for multi-tenant authentication, user management, and identity widgets.
- **Tinybird** for analytics ingest and dashboard metrics (daily link performance, country insights, etc.).
- **Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI** for consistent design tokens, light/dark theming, dialogs, and form controls.
- **Framer Motion** and **dnd-kit** for animated transitions, sortable lists, and delightful interactions.

> The result is a link-in-bio experience that feels as responsive as a native app, while still being easy to host on Vercel.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 20
- **pnpm** ≥ 9 (recommended) or npm 10+
- Convex account & CLI (`npm i -g convex`)
- Clerk account for auth (free tier works great)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/linkio.git
cd linkio
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
# or
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Convex & Clerk credentials

Fill in the environment variables described in the next section. Convex requires an `env` file per deployment (dev/prod) – the CLI will prompt you the first time you run `convex dev`.

### 4. Run the dev servers

```bash
pnpm dev
# launches Next.js + Convex side by side (see package.json scripts)
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the dashboard (Clerk handles sign-in). The public profile for any user slug is available at `/u/<username>`.

## 🔐 Environment Variables

You will typically create a `.env.local` at the repo root and configure Convex environment variables via `convex env set`.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` | Convex deployment URL ( auto-populated when running `convex dev`). |
| `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` | Convex project deployment name (optional for prod deploys). |
| `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Clerk publishable key for the browser. |
| `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` | Clerk secret key for server-side usage. |
| `CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN` | Required for Convex JWT template validation. |
| `TINYBIRD_TOKEN` | (Optional) API token for Tinybird analytics pipelines. |

> Tip: Run `pnpm convex dev --until-success` once to ensure the local Convex deployment is ready before booting Next.js.

## 🛠 Development Scripts

All scripts can be executed with `pnpm <script>` (or `npm run <script>`):

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `dev` | Runs Next.js and Convex dev servers concurrently. |
| `dev:frontend` | Starts the Next.js dev server only. |
| `dev:backend` | Starts the Convex dev server only. |
| `build` | Generates a production build. |
| `start` | Starts the Next.js production server. |
| `lint` | Runs Next.js ESLint checks. |
| `type-check` | Runs TypeScript compiler checks without emitting. |
| `test` | Placeholder – currently no automated tests. |


## 🧰 Useful Commands

```bash
# Deploy Convex functions & schema
pnpm convex deploy

# Push environment variables to Convex
pnpm convex env set <name> <value>

# Run Tinybird ingestion locally (requires CLI & token)
tinybird pipe run tinybird/pipes/link_analytics.pipe
```
